--- abstract

This document defines a new NTP DNS Resource Record, similar in concept to the HTTPS DNS Resource Record specified in [RFC9460].

This record enables an NTP server to indicate, via DNS, the versions ofthe NTP protocol it supports prior to the initiation of any NTP message exchange.

# Introduction

[NTPv5] is currently under standardization, and there are concerns regarding how clients select the newer NTP protocol version to use.

The server will drop NTP packets with unsupported versions. Even if a server implements support for NTPv5, a client will ordinarily initiate communication using NTPv4, assuming that NTPv4 is supported by the server. The server then advertises its NTPv5 support to the client using the NTPv4 reference timestamp.

The version of NTP used in the first request is therefore effectively based on implicit assumptions rather than explicit information, and the client has no reliable mechanism to determine the server’s supported versions in advance. This creates challenges for the deployment of future NTP protocol versions.

To address this challenge, this document defines a DNS-based mechanism similar to the HTTPS Resource Record ([RFC9460]). This mechanism enables a server to advertise the NTP protocol versions it supports before a client initiates any NTP communication.

# NTP Resource Record
The NTP Resource Record (RR type code TBD) is a SVCB-compatible RR type, as defined in [RFC9460].
It uses the same RDATA wire format as the SVCB RR, but its semantics are specialized for discovery and configuration of Network Time Protocol (NTP) services.

## example
The following example illustrates the presentation format of the NTP RR, showing how a server advertises support for multiple NTP protocol versions using the ntp-version SvcParamKey.

~~~
ntp.example.com. 300 IN NTP 1 . ntp-version=4,5
~~~

## ntp-version SvcParams
The ntp-version SvcParamKey indicates the set of NTP protocol versions supported by the service endpoint. Its value is a comma-separated list of ASCII version identifiers. Each version identifier consists of a numeric version number, optionally followed by a hyphen and an alphanumeric label (e.g., “5-draft5”), allowing servers to indicate support for development, experimental, or otherwise distinguished variants of a protocol version.

ABNF:

~~~
version           = 1*DIGIT *( "-" version-label )
version-label     = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
ntp-version-value = version *( "," version )
~~~

The wire-format consists of one or more version identifiers, each encoded as a length-prefixed byte sequence. These length–value pairs are concatenated to form the SvcParamValue.

# Operational Sequence and Client Behavior
The following list outlines the typical operational flow for deploying and using the NTP Resource Record, from server-side configuration to client-side version selection and communication. In practice, clients MAY perform NTP RR resolution in parallel with their default NTP initiation behavior (typically NTPv4, or NTPv5 when configured) and use the result when available.

- The server operator publishes an NTP RR in the authoritative DNS zone, including the appropriate SvcParams such as ntp-version="4,5".
- The client initiates DNS resolution for the NTP RR corresponding to the target domain name; if the NTP RR is not available, the client falls back to its default behavior (typically NTPv4).
- The client processes the DNS response using the rules for SVCB-compatible RR types.
  - If the response is in AliasMode (SvcPriority = 0), the client follows the alias target and repeats resolution.
  - If the response is in ServiceMode, the client proceeds to evaluate the associated SvcParams.
- The client parses known SvcParams; unknown parameters are ignored.
- If the ntp-version SvcParamKey is present, the client parses its value into a list of supported version identifiers.
- The client determines the intersection between its locally supported NTP versions and the versions listed in the ntp-version SvcParam.
- The client selects the highest mutually supported version and uses it as the version for the initial NTP request.
- If no mutually supported version exists, or if the NTP RR or its parameters are malformed, the client falls back to its default behavior (typically initiating communication using NTPv4).
- The client sends the first NTP request using the selected version.
- The server accepts the packet if the version is supported; packets using unsupported versions are dropped according to normal NTP behavior.
- NTP communication proceeds using the selected protocol version.
